# Questions
Calculate whether there are any significant differences in bill depth between species, whilst accounting for any other affects that might influence bill depth.

# Hypothesis 
There will be differences between species and bill depth according to the body weight and sex"  

* The response variables (dependent) is bill_depth_mm
* The predictor variables (independent) examined are sex, species and body weights.

# Data Structure
Overview of the columns in the data and data types.

```{r data structure }

knitr::kable(head(penguins))

str(penguins)

#group by species to see what species are there
knitr::kable(penguins %>% group_by(species) %>% count(species))

```

# Data Transformation
We have not made any transformations to this data set. Nothing has been removed and outlier remain.

# Data Visualisation

## Histogram 
Checking if flipper length is normal distributed for the three species.

``` {r histogram}

# Bill depth by species.
#Histogram checking for a normal distribution
histo <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x=bill_depth_mm, fill =species))

histo + 
  geom_histogram(position = 'identity', bins = 30) +
  theme_classic() +
  facet_grid(~ species)
```

## qqplot

Futher confirmation of a normal distrubution in this dataset

``` {r qqplot}
ggqqplot(penguins, x = "bill_depth_mm", color = "species")

```

## Boxplot 
This visualisation displays any difference in mean flipper length between the two species.

```{r boxplot }

#### Boxplot ###
billdepth_boxp <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm, col = species))
#boxplot
billdepth_boxp + geom_boxplot()

```
This visualisation shows that there is a difference in mean flipper length between the species.

# Creating GLM models

## Base R

``` {r}

#cross of predictors species and sex
# I need to try and add in both body_mass and sex as predictor variables
glm_norm_sex <- glm(bill_depth_mm ~ species * sex, data = penguins, family = "gaussian")

glm_norm_bw <- glm(bill_depth_mm ~ species * body_mass_g, data = penguins, family = "gaussian")


```

``` {r sex model}
# glm of sex

par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Change the panel layout to 2 x 2
plot(glm_norm_sex)
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # Change back to 1 x 1
```

``` {r species model}

# glm of body weight and sex

par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Change the panel layout to 2 x 2
plot(glm_norm_bw)
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # Change back to 1 x 1

```

We can see here that the model including the sex variable fits better.
Let visualise the sex model better through the performance package.

``` {r species sex performace}

check_model(glm_norm_sex)

```

# Interactions 

```{r}
plot_summs(glm_norm_sex, plot.distributions = TRUE, inner_ci_level = .9)

```


``` {r}
# compare species and sex models
plot_summs(glm_norm_sex,glm_norm_bw, 
           model.names = c("Species & Sex", "Species & Body weight")
           ,inner_ci_level = .9
           , rescale.distributions = TRUE
           )

```

# Compare interaction between bill depth and sex.

``` {r cat plot}
# Plot the interactions
# sex and species are both categorical variables
cat_plot(glm_norm_sex,
              pred = species,
              modx = sex)
```
